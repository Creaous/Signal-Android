# Signal Android (but less sucky)

This is a fork of Signal that provides SMS support. It is far (FAR) from completion, but at least it doesn't have those stupid, naggy messages telling you to update.

The `fork-5.53.8` branch is where the latest version is right now. Messy, I know, but I did this in less than an hour. I'll fix it eventually.

As far as I can tell, all messaging/calling/video calling features work fine.
